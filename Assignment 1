##Arrays in JAVA:

An array is a container object that holds a fixed 
number of values of a single type. 

The length of an array is established when the array 
is created. 

After creation, its length is fixed. You have seen an 
example of arrays already, in the main method of the
 "Hello World!" application.


##Jva program for a static variable:

Java Program to demonstrate the use of static variable  
class Student{  
   int rollno;//instance variable  
   String name;  
   static String college ="ITS";//static variable  
   //constructor  
   Student(int r, String n){  
   rollno = r;  
   name = n;  
   }  
   //method to display the values  
   void display (){System.out.println(rollno+" "+name+" "+college);}  
}  
//Test class to show the values of objects  
public class TestStaticVariable1{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
 Student s1 = new Student(111,"Karan");  
 Student s2 = new Student(222,"Aryan");  
 //we can change the college of all objects by the single line of code  
 //Student.college="BBDIT";  
 s1.display();  
 s2.display();  
 }  
}  

##Jva program instance variables:

public class Student {

 public int studentId;

 public String name;

 public int age;

 // here we have created three instance variable. All these can be accesible

 // in all methods of this class.

 public int getStudentId() {

  return studentId;

 }

 public void setStudentId(int studentId) {

  this.studentId = studentId;

 }

 public String getName() {

  return name;

 }

 public void setName(String name) {

  this.name = name;

 }

 public int getAge() {

  return age;

 }

 public void setAge(int age) {

  this.age = age;

 }

}
